# Text files that always will have LF line endings on checkout,
# because they are generated by XML tools, that normalize line breaks,
# and thus convert the combination of carriage return and line feed
# to a line feed,
# see also https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-line-ends.
# These settings prevent differences between versions only caused by
# line end differences.
